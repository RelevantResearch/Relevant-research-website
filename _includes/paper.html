              IMMIGRANT DETENTION METHODOLOGY PAPER
            </h2>
            <p class="card-text lead">
              <strong>Executive Summary:</strong> In this paper, Relevant
              Research provides a methodology for estimating recent daily
              averages of ICE's detained population by facility based on the
              Congressionally mandated detention data released by the agency on
              a biweekly basis. On the surface, ICE's detention data spreadsheet
              provides a recent national total for its detained population and
              facility-level population averages calculated as an average daily
              population for the fiscal year to date (starting on October 1)â€”but
              no specific recent numbers for each detention facility. The
              methodology described below does not answer the question of
              precisely how many people are in an ICE facility at a recent point
              in time, but it does provide an estimated average daily population
              for the most recent interval between ICE data releases. Depending
              on each facility and how significantly ICE detention numbers
              fluctuate, ICE's reported average daily population ("reported
              ADP") and our estimated recent average daily population ("interval
              ADP") diverge to varying degrees.
