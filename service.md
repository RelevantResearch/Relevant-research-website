A personal website is a must-have for graduate students, faculty, and scholars at any stage of their career. Your website is your business card, your portfolio, and your CV all in one. And it’s more important than ever for you to own and control your professional website so that it can travel with you wherever your career takes you.

Professional websites have become common, but do-it-yourself website platforms and most for-hire web developers still don’t understand the unique needs of academics. As academics ourselves, we understand that your website should be stable, secure, affordable, and easy to update with your latest accomplishments.

That’s why we created Relevant Research in the first place: to develop solutions uniquely tailored for academics so that you can expand the impact of your valuable work. We can build a professional website for you that showcases your entire scholarly identity, including your research and teaching experience, your conference and speaking events, and other forms of public engagement.

Every website we build is uniquely tailored to your vision for your online presence. But because we know you’re busy, we offer an innovative quick-start process to get your site up and running with minimum fuss from you. We also understand that you may want to explore your options first before committing to a new website.

To get started, register for an initial consultation to discuss your goals and your options over the phone or over Zoom. If you choose to go with Relevant Research, your consultation fee will go towards the overall cost of developing your website.
